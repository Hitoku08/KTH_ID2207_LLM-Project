# KTH_ID2207_LLM-Project

A simple software application for KTH University students, built to record and report daily and monthly study hours per subject. This application leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) in all stages of developmentâ€”from design and coding to testing. The project provides practical insights into the use of AI tools in the software development lifecycle.

### Features

- **Daily Study Log:** Track daily study hours for different subjects.
- **Monthly Reports:** Generate monthly summaries that display total study hours for each subject and the overall monthly total.
- **AI-Enhanced Development:** Architecture, coding, and testing stages were supported by LLMs, with iterative prompt refinements to improve output quality.

### Project Details

- **Technologies:** Web or standalone application, minimalistic interface (2-3 pages or features).
- **Development Process:** Utilized LLMs to aid in designing system architecture, generating code, and creating test cases. Modifications to LLM-generated artifacts were documented and tested for accuracy.
- **Documentation:** The project includes detailed documentation on prompts, prompt refinement strategies, testing results, and user experience with LLMs.
